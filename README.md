# ProjetoFoodWaste
:hamburger: Final project of IT technical course. Application for supermarkets to donate surplus food to charities instituitions, reducing hunger and food waste.

The application works as a way to connect supermarkets that want to donate food in good condition and institutions that need more food to feed their dependents.
- Research and studies have been done on the issues of food insecurity and food waste, as well on Law 14016 that validates the implementation of the project.
